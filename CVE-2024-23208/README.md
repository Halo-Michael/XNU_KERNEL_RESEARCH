1. Here this POC only can be triggered from 14.0 to 14.2.1 of macOS
2. We can achieve a similar effect to fork for updating "last_pid" on iOS by using the function named "msgsend" in conjunction with the SCM_RIGHTS method to pass the file descriptor from one Application to another Application.

1. I have submitted the code that will crash my iPhone, and you should build "main_App" and "recv_App" on your iPhone. and launch the "recv_App" firstly, then launch "main_App", it will let your iPhone panic or crash. no any other content about it, only crash in it.
2. Let me reiterate what I said, the PoC is only can make device crash when kernel trigger the bug,I'm not able to complete the KR/KW. Maybe you should try to bypass the mitigation of XNU about the "zone".
3. Thank all researchers and lovers for your hard work.
